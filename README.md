# real_state_web_scraper
This is my first scraper using Selenium + XPATH tool. Since I have always liked real state, I decided to create a program that allows me to download important information to later manipulate and analyze it.

Platzi's web scraping courses helped me a lot, clearly stackoverflow is an amazing extra help to highlight. 

This is another project in my Data Science route, I know that it can be improved a lot, feel free to help me!!
