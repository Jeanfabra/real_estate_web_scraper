# real_state_web_scraper
This is my first scraper using Selenium + XPATH tool. Since I have always liked real state, I decided to create a program that allows the user to download important information to later manipulate and analyze it.

This program allows the user to download the following data:

  * Location of the apartment
  * Price 
  * Size
  * Number of bathrooms
  * Number of Bedrooms
  * Link to the apartment 

Platzi's web scraping courses helped me a lot, clearly stackoverflow is an amazing extra help to highlight. 

This is another project in my Data Science route, I know that it can be improved a lot, feel free to help me!!
